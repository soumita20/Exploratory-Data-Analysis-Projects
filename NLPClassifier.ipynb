Text in the form of blogs, posts, articles, etc. is written every second. It is a challenge to predict the information about the writer without knowing about him/her. We are going to create a classifier that predicts multiple features of the author of a given text. We have designed it as a Multi label classification problem.\n","\n","DATA DESCRIPTION: Over 600,000 posts from more than 19 thousand bloggers The Blog Authorship Corpus consists of the collected\n","posts of 19,320 bloggers gathered from blogger.com in August 2004. The corpus incorporates a total of 681,288 posts and over 140 million words - or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person. Each blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the blogger’s self-provided gender, age, industry, and astrological sign. (All are labelled for gender and age but for many,\n","industry and/or sign is marked as unknown.) All bloggers included in the corpus fall into one of three age groups:\n","• 8240 \"10s\" blogs (ages 13-17),\n","• 8086 \"20s\" blogs(ages 23-27) and\n","• 2994 \"30s\" blogs (ages 33-47)\n","For each age group, there is an equal number of male and female bloggers.\n","Each blog in the corpus includes at least 200 occurrences of common English words. All formatting has been stripped with two exceptions.\n","Individual posts within a single blogger are separated by the date of the following post and links within a post are denoted by the label url\n","link. \n","\n","Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus\n","\n","PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The need is to build a NLP classifier which can use input text parameters to determine the label/s of the blog.\n","\n","Steps and tasks:\n","1. Import and analyse the data set.\n","2. Perform data pre-processing on the data:\n","• Data cleansing by removing unwanted characters, spaces, stop words etc. Convert text to lowercase.\n","• Target/label merger and transformation\n","• Train and test split\n","• Vectorisation, etc.\n","3. Design, train, tune and test the best text classifier.\n","4. Display and explain detail the classification report\n","5. Print the true vs predicted labels for any 5 entries from the dataset.\n","\n","Hint: The aim here Is to import the text, process it such a way that it can be taken as an inout to the ML/NN classifiers. Be analytical and experimental here in trying new\n","approaches to design the best model."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"87MQxhsHJwsg","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620581941422,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1591,"user":{"displayName":"Soumita Chowdhury","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhObdw1u3uxDno8PBnDrmkvcHccSnXmpjy2A7PQ=s64","userId":"09157550983538090427"}},"outputId":"aeb82bb1-0e50-482e-eaf9-ba0225f71979"},"source":["#Set tensorflow version\n","%tensorflow_version 2.x\n","import tensorflow\n","tensorflow.__version__"],"execution_count":237,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'2.4.1'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":237}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Xyuhc06AHBRg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620581942181,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2339,"user":{"displayName":"Soumita Chowdhury","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhObdw1u3uxDno8PBnDrmkvcHccSnXmpjy2A7PQ=s64","userId":"09157550983538090427"}}},"source":["# Initialize the random number generator\n","import random\n","random.seed(0)\n","\n","# Ignore the warnings\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")"],"execution_count":238,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"t23cFHI4HEei","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620581942182,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2334,"user":{"displayName":"Soumita Chowdhury","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhObdw1u3uxDno8PBnDrmkvcHccSnXmpjy2A7PQ=s64","userId":"09157550983538090427"}}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # data visualization library\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import seaborn as sns"],"execution_count":239,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"P_GtTUyEhjdz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620581942183,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2329,"user":{"displayName":"Soumita Chowdhury","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhObdw1u3uxDno8PBnDrmkvcHccSnXmpjy2A7PQ=s64","userId":"09157550983538090427"}}},"source":["import re\n","import nltk\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, average_precision_score, recall_score\n","\n","\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n","from string import punctuation\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer #word stemmer class\n","lemma = WordNetLemmatizer()\n","from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n","from nltk import FreqDist"],"execution_count":240,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"K6Xoy4oNmAGu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620581942184,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2324,"user":{"displayName":"Soumita Chowdhury","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhObdw1u3uxDno8PBnDrmkvcHccSnXmpjy2A7PQ=s64","userId":"09157550983538090427"}},"outputId":"78def495-33de-4122-88df-ab1e415c4eff"},"source":["#Let us load the data\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(\"/content/gdrive\")"],"execution_count":241,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/gdrive;
